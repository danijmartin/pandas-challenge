# Pandas Challenge

In this jupyter notebook we review a school district's data regarding math and reading test scores.

First we review the district as whole and see there is a 65.17% overall passing rate (passed both math and reading).

From there we review each school's passing rates.

This school summary is then further broken down to see the following:
Top and bottom performers  
How each grade performs at each school  
Performance based on spending per student  
Performance based on school size  
Performance based on school type  

### Interesting Insights from the tables

* Passing Rates are very consistent for each school across each grade level. This suggests no school has any gaps between grade levels.  
* As spending per student increases, average scores and overall passing rates actually decrease. Further research is needed here.
* Smaller schools perform better in testing
* Charter schools perform better than standard district schools

### Additional Insights

* If we take a closer look at the data, in most cases charter schools are smaller than district schools and operate on smaller budgets 
per student. Further research is needed to determine which factor, or combination of factors is playing a key role in test scores.
